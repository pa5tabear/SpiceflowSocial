# Sprint Plan Number One — Spiceflow Social

## Purpose

Translate the Spiceflow Social master plan into an actionable roadmap composed of ten themed sprints. Each sprint focuses on a coherent capability set and includes representative subtasks that will later be expanded into detailed sprint backlogs.

## Sprint Outline

### Sprint 1 — Repository Foundation & Tooling
* Confirm repository structure aligned with master plan directories (`docs/`, `data/`, `src/`, `tests/`).
* Establish Python environment (Poetry/virtualenv) and baseline dependency list.
* Configure formatting, linting, and testing workflows (pre-commit, CI stub).
* Draft contribution and security guidelines tailored to sensitive personal data.
* Produce initial project backlog issue list reflecting master plan phases.

### Sprint 2 — Personal Data Intake Preparation
* Finalize formats for goals, preferences, and contact documents (YAML/Markdown schemas).
* Define secure storage approach for sensitive files and update `.gitignore` rules.
* Author sample/redacted versions of goals and contacts for testing purposes.
* Document manual processes for updating personal documents.
* Validate schema compatibility with planned ingestion modules.

### Sprint 3 — Event Source Aggregation
* Inventory Chrome bookmark export structure and identify calendar URL patterns.
* Design ingestion adapters for ICS feeds and HTML-only calendars.
* Prototype bookmark parser that extracts calendar metadata into normalized records.
* Establish validation rules for deduplicating and tagging events.
* Set up fixtures representing a subset of real calendars for automated tests.

### Sprint 4 — Availability Detection Pipeline
* Configure Google Cloud project and OAuth credentials for calendar access.
* Implement free/busy retrieval for 6–10 PM windows across 30 days.
* Normalize availability data model, including location context for adjacent events.
* Persist availability snapshots for downstream recommendation processing.
* Add monitoring hooks for API quota usage and token refresh.

### Sprint 5 — Goals & Preference Structuring
* Parse goals/preferences document into machine-readable objects with weights and constraints.
* Map entertainment, intellectual, social, fitness, and professional dimensions to scoring parameters.
* Encode cadence rules for relationship outreach and recovery spacing for workouts.
* Create validation suite to ensure documents satisfy schema and constraint expectations.
* Surface configuration toggles for tuning scoring emphasis per goal area.

### Sprint 6 — Scoring & Constraint Engine
* Implement weighted scoring functions for events and outreach options.
* Model constraint checks (e.g., max strength sessions per week, weather exclusions).
* Introduce rule engine or orchestrated evaluators for balancing conflicting goals.
* Provide explainability metadata (reason codes, contributing factors) per evaluation.
* Unit test edge cases such as conflicting preferences and empty schedules.

### Sprint 7 — Recommendation Assembly
* Merge availability, event scores, and constraint results into ranked suggestions.
* Handle fallbacks when no event meets thresholds (relationship outreach, at-home plans).
* Optimize selection algorithm for variety across consecutive evenings.
* Track recommendation history to avoid repetitive suggestions.
* Prepare API/service interface for generating daily recommendation payloads.

### Sprint 8 — Weather & Wellbeing Intelligence
* Integrate chosen weather API with caching strategy for 30-day forecasts.
* Translate weather data into actionable suitability signals for outdoor events.
* Extend wellbeing rules to account for fatigue, travel time, and preparation buffers.
* Incorporate location intelligence for commute feasibility checks.
* Establish alerting when weather data is unavailable or stale.

### Sprint 9 — Experience Delivery & Feedback Loop
* Design report templates (Markdown/email/dashboard) summarizing evening plans.
* Implement delivery mechanisms (Git-generated reports, email sender, optional UI hooks).
* Capture user feedback inputs to adjust scoring weights and constraints.
* Log rationale and outcomes for each recommendation cycle.
* Draft user guide describing how to interpret outputs and supply feedback.

### Sprint 10 — Automation, Monitoring & Privacy Hardening
* Schedule nightly/weekly automation jobs for data refresh and recommendation generation.
* Implement observability metrics (success/failure counts, latency, API usage).
* Harden credential management with encrypted secrets handling and rotation procedures.
* Conduct privacy review ensuring personal data remains out of version control.
* Compile retrospective insights and prepare backlog for subsequent iteration cycles.
