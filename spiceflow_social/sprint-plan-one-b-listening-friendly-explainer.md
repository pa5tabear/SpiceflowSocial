# Sprint Plan One-B — Listening-Friendly Explainer

Below is a conversational walkthrough of the ten-sprint roadmap. Each section pairs with the technical plan but uses everyday language so it is easy to follow along during planning meetings or audio reviews.

## Sprint 1 — Laying the Foundation
We start by getting the house in order. This sprint sets up the project folders, testing tools, and contribution guidelines so everyone knows how to work safely with sensitive personal data. When we finish, we will have a clean skeleton of the app, automated checks that run on every change, and clear instructions for future collaborators.

## Sprint 2 — Preparing Personal Inputs
Next, we shape the documents that describe goals, preferences, and key relationships. We will agree on easy-to-edit templates, create safe practice files, and document how to keep real information secure. By the end, we can quickly verify whether new entries follow the agreed format before the software ever touches them.

## Sprint 3 — Collecting Event Sources
With the personal inputs ready, we turn to the calendar sources. This sprint teaches the system how to read the Chrome bookmark folder, pull events from different calendar formats, and clean up duplicates. Test data will prove that the pipeline can handle a mix of feeds without making a mess.

## Sprint 4 — Understanding Availability
Here we connect to Google Calendar so the assistant can see which evenings are open between 6 and 10 PM. We will store this availability information, keep an eye on API usage, and make sure location details from nearby meetings are captured. After this sprint, the system knows when it is allowed to schedule anything at all.

## Sprint 5 — Translating Goals and Preferences
Now we teach the software how to interpret the personal strategy guide. Entertainment versus intellectual stimulation, social needs, fitness cadence, and professional ambitions all become numbers the system can reason about. Validation checks ensure the preferences never contradict each other without warning us first.

## Sprint 6 — Scoring Every Option
Armed with inputs and availability, we build the scoring brain. This sprint calculates how well each event or outreach idea matches the preferences, while also blocking suggestions that break important rules like recovery days. Every score carries an explanation so we can trace the logic later.

## Sprint 7 — Crafting Recommendations
Once scoring works, we weave everything together into nightly recommendations. The assistant will pick the best option for each free evening, suggest backups when needed, and remember recent choices so plans stay fresh. The output will be ready for reports or other delivery channels.

## Sprint 8 — Respecting Weather and Wellbeing
Weather and recovery can make or break a plan, so this sprint layers in forecast data and smarter wellbeing checks. Outdoor events get filtered when the weather looks rough, and travel time or fatigue warnings can nudge the system toward gentler ideas. Resilience features make sure we notice when the weather feed goes quiet.

## Sprint 9 — Sharing Results and Gathering Feedback
With recommendations in hand, we focus on delivery. We design polished summaries that can be sent by email or read as Markdown, and we add simple ways to log reactions after each evening. This feedback loop helps fine-tune the scoring so future suggestions feel more personal.

## Sprint 10 — Automating and Safeguarding Operations
Finally, we automate the routine and tighten security. Scheduled jobs refresh the plan without manual effort, monitoring keeps tabs on success or failure, and a privacy review confirms that sensitive information stays protected. We wrap up with a retrospective and queue up the next round of improvements.
