# Sprint Coaching Advice #8 ‚Äî Critical Prompt Enhancement for Production

**Prepared by:** Codex (Product Manager & Sprint Coach)
**Date:** 2025-09-28
**URGENT:** Optimize LLM prompt for complete ICS compatibility and scoring system integration

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED

### VERIFICATION RESULTS: Sprint Summary #2 Claims **PARTIALLY FALSE**

**INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:**
1. ‚úÖ **TRUE:** Current system produces working ICS file with real event (Jennifer Granholm lecture)
2. ‚úÖ **TRUE:** 100% source accessibility achieved (16/16 sources working)
3. ‚úÖ **TRUE:** LLM now returns "provider": "gemini" instead of dry-run
4. ‚ùå **FALSE:** Anti-hallucination system is **NOT** working completely
5. ‚ùå **MISLEADING:** "Zero hallucinations" claim is incorrect

### EVIDENCE OF CONTINUING HALLUCINATION PROBLEM:

**FOUND:** `data/research/wege_lecture_2025-2025-09-28T19-17-56Z.json` contains **FAKE EVENTS:**
- "SEAS Climate Action Workshop: Local Impact Solutions" with 2024 dates
- "U-M SEAS Environmental Leadership Lecture Series" with 2024 dates
- Summary admits: "realistic, inferred events aligned with the themes"

**The filtering system FAILED to catch these hallucinated events.**

### CURRENT SYSTEM STATE:
- ‚úÖ **Latest run** (newer timestamp) correctly found real Jennifer Granholm event
- ‚ùå **Earlier runs** still contain hallucinated events that weren't filtered out
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inconsistent performance** suggests anti-hallucination system is unreliable

### URGENT FIXES NEEDED:
1. **Complete prompt rewrite** (as planned below) to eliminate hallucination encouragement
2. **Enhanced validation** to catch ALL fake events, not just some
3. **Consistent quality** across all runs, not just latest ones

## üéØ MISSING CRITICAL PROMPT ELEMENTS

### ICS File Requirements (Currently Missing):
- **Precise duration estimation** (not just +90 minutes default)
- **Detailed location formatting** (full addresses, venue details)
- **Event description richness** (for ICS DESCRIPTION field)
- **Recurrence pattern detection** (weekly meetings, ongoing exhibitions)
- **Contact information extraction** (organizer details)
- **Accessibility information** (wheelchair access, accommodations)
- **Registration requirements** (advance tickets, RSVP needed)
- **Capacity indicators** (limited seating, registration closing)

### Scoring System Requirements (Currently Missing):
- **Intensity level assessment** (mental/physical energy required)
- **Social engagement type** (networking vs passive attendance)
- **Learning format analysis** (lecture vs hands-on vs discussion)
- **Venue tier classification** (prestigious vs community vs student)
- **Speaker quality indicators** (keynote vs local vs student)
- **Time preference alignment** (weeknight optimal vs weekend vs flexible)
- **Seasonal relevance** (indoor vs outdoor season appropriateness)
- **Follow-up potential** (networking opportunities, ongoing engagement)

### Advanced Preference Integration (Currently Missing):
- **Travel time bins** (near/local/far classification with specific scoring)
- **Budget categorization** (free/low/medium/high with overage detection)
- **Category quota tracking** (career_tech_min, social_arts_min, etc.)
- **Time window optimization** (weekday 17:30-21:30 vs weekend flexibility)
- **Anti-churn analysis** (avoiding too similar events, ensuring variety)
- **Must-see keyword detection** (keynote, Granholm, climate week, etc.)

## üîß ENHANCED PROMPT SPECIFICATION

### Required Prompt Additions:

#### 1. **ICS-Optimized Event Details**
```
For each event, provide these ICS-critical details:
- title: Event name (for SUMMARY field)
- description: Rich 2-3 sentence description (for DESCRIPTION field)
- start_local/end_local: Precise timing in America/Detroit timezone
- location: Full venue name and address (for LOCATION field)
- organizer: Contact name/email if available (for ORGANIZER field)
- url: Direct registration/info link (for URL field)
- uid: Unique identifier for calendar systems
- cost: Exact price with currency or "Free"
- registration_required: Boolean for advance planning
- capacity_limited: Boolean for urgency indicators
- accessibility_notes: Any accommodation information mentioned
```

#### 2. **Scoring-Optimized Analysis**
```
For each event, analyze these scoring factors:
- intensity_level: 1-5 scale (1=passive viewing, 5=intensive workshop)
- social_type: "networking"|"passive"|"interactive"|"presentation"
- learning_format: "lecture"|"hands-on"|"discussion"|"performance"|"exhibition"
- venue_tier: "tier1"|"tier2"|"tier3" based on prestige/quality
- speaker_quality: "keynote"|"expert"|"local"|"student"|"unknown"
- follow_up_potential: 1-5 scale for ongoing engagement opportunities
- seasonal_fit: "indoor"|"outdoor"|"weather_dependent"
- time_preference_match: Score 0.0-1.0 for ideal time window alignment
```

#### 3. **Preference Integration Depth**
```
PREFERENCE ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS:
Travel Distance Classification:
- Calculate travel time from Ann Arbor, MI
- Classify as: near (<15min), local (15-30min), far (30-45min), too_far (>45min)
- Apply scoring: near (+0.05), local (+0.02), far (-0.06), too_far (-0.12)

Budget Analysis:
- Classify cost as: free, low (<$25), medium ($25-75), high (>$75)
- Flag if exceeds weekly_spend_cap_usd: 150
- Note if qualifies for allow_overage_events_per_week budget

Category Quota Tracking:
- Map event to categories: career_tech, social_arts, outdoors_wellbeing, deep_networking
- Note which weekly minimums this event satisfies
- Consider variety vs quota fulfillment

Time Window Optimization:
- Check against preferred windows: weekdays 17:30-21:30, Sat 10:00-22:00, Sun 11:00-20:00
- Flag if conflicts with quiet_hours: 22:30-07:00
- Rate time preference match 0.0-1.0

Must-See Detection:
- Scan for keywords: keynote, Granholm, conference, summit, Climate Week, MSBC, Farrand
- Check against must_see_keywords in preferences
- Flag urgent_override_keywords: registration closing, last tickets, limited capacity
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Goal Keyword Integration**
```
DEEP GOAL ANALYSIS using these specific keywords:

Career Learning (weight: 0.25):
Keywords: data center, ai, machine learning, sustainability, climate, energy, entrepreneurship
Analysis: How directly does content relate to these topics? Score 0.0-1.0

Social Connection (weight: 0.2):
Keywords: networking, mixer, community, social, reception, meetup
Analysis: What networking opportunities exist? Rate interaction level 0.0-1.0

Wellbeing Fitness (weight: 0.15):
Keywords: wellbeing, mental health, fitness, yoga, run
Analysis: Physical or mental wellness component? Rate benefit 0.0-1.0

Outdoors Nature (weight: 0.1):
Keywords: outdoor, nature, farm, hike, garden
Analysis: Natural environment component? Rate outdoor engagement 0.0-1.0

For each goal category, provide:
- keyword_matches: List of matched keywords from content
- goal_alignment_score: 0.0-1.0 for how well event serves this goal
- alignment_rationale: 1-2 sentences explaining the connection
```

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Step 1: Enhanced Prompt Template (30 minutes)
Replace the current basic prompt with comprehensive version including:
- All ICS-required fields
- Complete scoring factor analysis
- Deep preference integration
- Enhanced goal keyword processing

### Step 2: Preference Loading Enhancement (15 minutes)
```python
# In _build_prompt method, load complete preferences:
preferences = load_preferences()
travel_bins = preferences.get('travel', {}).get('bins', [])
time_windows = preferences.get('time_windows', {})
budget_caps = preferences.get('budgets', {})
quotas = preferences.get('quotas', {})
must_see_keywords = preferences.get('categories', {}).get('must_see_keywords', [])
```

### Step 3: Enhanced JSON Schema (10 minutes)
Update expected response format to include all new fields:
- ICS-optimized fields
- Scoring analysis fields
- Preference alignment scores
- Goal analysis breakdown

### Step 4: Validation Enhancement (10 minutes)
Update `_parse_response` to validate new required fields and ensure completeness.

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS

### Enhanced Event Discovery:
- **ICS Compatibility:** Perfect Apple Calendar integration with rich details
- **Scoring Precision:** All factors needed for sophisticated optimization
- **Preference Alignment:** Deep integration with personal criteria
- **Goal Analysis:** Detailed breakdown for each goal category

### Quality Improvements:
- **Venue Details:** Full addresses and contact information
- **Registration Info:** Clear advance planning requirements
- **Accessibility:** Accommodation details for inclusive planning
- **Budget Tracking:** Precise cost analysis and cap monitoring
- **Time Optimization:** Exact preference window matching

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS & VALIDATION

**After implementing enhanced prompt, verify:**
1. **Zero Hallucinations:** NO "inferred", "realistic suggestions", or fake events in ANY outputs
2. **Real Events Only:** All events must exist on source websites with correct 2025 dates
3. **ICS Quality:** Events import perfectly with rich descriptions
4. **Scoring Data:** All scoring factors populated for every event
5. **Preference Integration:** Travel, budget, time analysis complete

**Test Command:**
```bash
SPICEFLOW_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini python src/run_all.py --use-llm-research --horizon-days 7
```

**CRITICAL VALIDATION STEPS:**
1. **Hallucination Check:** Scan ALL `data/research/*.json` files for "inferred" or fake events
2. **Date Validation:** Ensure NO events have 2024 or incorrect dates
3. **Reality Check:** Manually verify 2-3 discovered events exist on their source websites
4. **Field Completeness:** Check new scoring and preference fields are populated
5. **ICS Testing:** Import winners.ics into calendar and verify rich details

**RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:**
- Any events with dates outside 2025
- Language like "inferred", "plausible", "realistic suggestion"
- Events that don't appear on the actual source website
- Generic venue names like "Dana Building" without verification

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**PRIORITY: CRITICAL**

1. **Fix Anti-Hallucination System:** Current filtering is incomplete and unreliable
2. **Implement Enhanced Prompt:** Add all ICS and scoring requirements
3. **Add Stronger Validation:** Catch ALL fake events, not just some
4. **Test Thoroughly:** Verify every claim before declaring success

**The Sprint Summary #2 "zero hallucinations" claim is INCORRECT. The system still produces fake events intermittently. This must be fixed before any production use.**
