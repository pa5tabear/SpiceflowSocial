### READY FOR DAILY USE:
The system has achieved the **primary goal**: a high-quality markdown file with real LLM research that can serve as training data for the curation system.

**Core Deliverable Achieved:**
- `data/out/weekly_llm_research.md` - Professional-grade event research
- `data/out/winners.ics` - Production calendar file ready for import
- Real web content analysis, not hallucinated events
- Perfect integration with existing pipeline

## üöÄ NEXT PHASE STRATEGY: SCALE & OPTIMIZE

Since the **foundation is now excellent**, the next sprint should focus on optimization and scaling rather than fundamental fixes.

### Priority 1: Source Expansion (THIS WEEK)
**Rationale:** 18.75% event discovery rate suggests need for more diverse sources

**DELIVERABLES:**
1. **Add 10-15 New Event Sources**
   - Research local Ann Arbor event calendars beyond UM
   - Include community centers, libraries, downtown venues
   - Add recurring series (art galleries, music venues, clubs)
   - Target: 40+ events per week discovery rate

2. **Source Quality Analysis**
   - Create `data/out/source_performance_report.md`
   - Rank sources by event discovery success rate
   - Identify which source types produce best evening events
   - Recommend source pruning vs expansion

3. **Source Configuration Optimization**
   - Add more granular categorization in `sources.yaml`
   - Include source-specific prompt hints for better analysis
   - Test different scraping frequencies for dynamic sources

### Priority 2: Production Automation (THIS WEEK)
**Rationale:** Manual runs are not sustainable for daily usage

**DELIVERABLES:**
1. **Daily Automation Script**
   - Create `scripts/daily_research.sh` for nightly runs
   - Include error handling and status reporting
   - Generate timestamp-based research archives
   - Email/notification on completion or failure

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track API usage and costs over time
   - Monitor source accessibility trends
   - Alert on significant drops in event discovery
   - Generate weekly performance summaries

3. **Quality Assurance Automation**
   - Automated validation that events have 2025 dates
   - Check for hallucination indicators in batch
   - Verify ICS file validity before publishing
   - Flag unusual patterns for human review

### Priority 3: Scoring System Enhancement (NEXT WEEK)
**Rationale:** Current scoring works but can be optimized based on real event data

**DELIVERABLES:**
1. **Real-World Scoring Calibration**
   - Analyze scores of discovered events vs manual preferences
   - Adjust goal weights based on actual event quality
   - Test scoring variations against discovered event corpus
   - Document optimal configuration

2. **Enhanced Goal Integration**
   - Create more specific fit_rationale analysis
   - Include negative scoring for misaligned events
   - Add seasonal/temporal preferences (weeknight vs weekend)
   - Integrate travel time more sophisticated scoring

3. **Learning System Foundation**
   - Track which events get accepted/declined in practice
   - Create feedback loop for scoring improvement
   - Begin collecting user preference data for ML training
   - Design preference learning system architecture

## üîß TECHNICAL OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Gemini API Optimization
**Current Status:** Working well with 2.5 Pro
**Improvements:**
- Test batching multiple sources per API call for efficiency
- Experiment with temperature settings for different source types
- Optimize token usage while maintaining quality
- Add retry logic for transient API failures

### Content Processing Enhancement
**Current Status:** 100% source accessibility achieved
**Improvements:**
- Add JavaScript execution for dynamic content sites
- Implement content caching for frequently updated sources
- Add multi-format parsing (PDF, calendar feeds, social media)

## üìã SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Product Development:
1. **Begin Daily Usage:** Start importing `winners.ics` into your calendar daily
2. **Collect Feedback:** Track which recommended events you actually attend
3. **Source Suggestions:** Identify local venues/organizations missing from current sources
4. **Preference Refinement:** Note when scoring doesn't match your actual preferences

### For Technical Development:
1. **Source Research:** Spend 2-3 hours finding 15 new quality event sources
2. **Automation Implementation:** Create daily run script with proper error handling
3. **Performance Baseline:** Document current API costs and runtime metrics
