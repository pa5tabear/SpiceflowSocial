# Sprint Coaching Advice #5 ‚Äî Post-Sprint Production Readiness

**Prepared by:** Codex (Product Manager & Sprint Coach)
**Date:** 2025-09-28
**Sprint Review:** Sprint Summary #1 Analysis

## 1. Sprint Performance Assessment

**EXCELLENT EXECUTION** ‚úÖ ‚Äî Sprint Summary #1 demonstrates disciplined completion of all targeted objectives with comprehensive documentation and validation. The team successfully:

- Fixed critical LLM integration bugs and implemented proper context fetching
- Added resilient fallback logic with clear logging for failed research attempts
- Achieved 100% test suite pass rate (13/13 tests passing)
- Validated end-to-end pipeline functionality with real event discovery (37 events ‚Üí 8 winners)
- Maintained security hygiene with proper `.gitignore` configuration

This represents a **mature sprint execution** with proper Definition of Done adherence, thorough testing, and production-ready artifacts.

## 2. Current Pipeline Status Analysis

### Strengths to Amplify
- **Robust event discovery:** 8 quality events selected from 37 candidates shows effective filtering
- **Multi-modal approach:** Both scraper and LLM research paths working, providing redundancy
- **Quality scoring:** Events like "ScentStories" (AI & Aroma) and Ukrainian art exhibition show sophisticated goal alignment
- **Production artifacts:** Clean ICS exports and daily markdown generation ready for immediate use

### Immediate Tactical Opportunities
Based on the current `shortlist.md` output, I observe:
- **Score distribution insight:** Events scoring 0.5 (art exhibitions) to 0.0 (astronomy shows) suggests scoring weights may need calibration
- **Duplicate detection working:** Same events appearing on different dates properly handled
- **Category diversity achieved:** Mix of arts, science, and experiential events shows balanced portfolio

## 3. SINGULAR FOCUS: High-Quality LLM Research Markdown

### THE ONLY PRIORITY: LLM Research Markdown File
**CREDENTIALS READY:** Gemini API key is already configured in `data/secrets/secrets.md` ‚Äî no setup needed.

**SINGLE DELIVERABLE THIS WEEK:**
**Create a perfect `data/out/weekly_llm_research.md` file that demonstrates high-quality LLM event discovery**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Use Gemini 2.5 Pro Model:** Ensure pipeline configured for high-quality model (not basic Gemini)
2. **Enable High Token Output:** Configure for detailed, comprehensive research (not truncated responses)
3. **Real Website Research:** LLM must access actual website content, not just metadata
4. **Network Access Required:** Ensure Claude Code has full network access when running agents
5. **Tool Usage:** LLM must use web browsing/retrieval tools to access live content

**Technical Implementation:**
- Run: `SPICEFLOW_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini python src/run_all.py --use-llm-research --horizon-days 7`
- Verify: Gemini API calls show actual website content in prompts
- Confirm: Research responses contain detailed analysis of source content
- Validate: Events discovered include details only available from live web access

**Success Criteria:**
- Markdown shows LLM actually browsed and analyzed website content
- Research includes event details not visible in source metadata
- High-quality event descriptions with context and analysis
- Working ICS file ready for calendar import
- Token counts indicate comprehensive research (not minimal responses)

**IMMEDIATE DEBUG IF:** LLM returns empty events or generic placeholders - fix API configuration and web access first.**

## 4. What NOT To Build (Anti-Roadmap)

### DO NOT BUILD THESE UNTIL LLM RESEARCH WORKS:
- ‚ùå Source health dashboards
- ‚ùå Monitoring systems
- ‚ùå Performance reports
- ‚ùå Additional scrapers
- ‚ùå OAuth integrations
- ‚ùå Mobile workflows
- ‚ùå Obsidian exports
- ‚ùå Alert systems

### ONLY BUILD AFTER LLM MARKDOWN IS PERFECT:
Once the LLM research markdown file is working beautifully, then consider:
- Enhanced scoring based on LLM insights
- Additional event sources
- Better curation algorithms

### SUCCESS GATE:
**The LLM research markdown file must be production-quality before ANY other development work begins.**

## 5. Medium-Term Strategic Priorities

### Obsidian Integration (Weeks 3-4)
The sprint summary correctly identifies mobile consumption as a key workflow gap.

**REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:**
1. **DELIVERABLE: Obsidian Export Scripts**
   - **Artifacts:** `scripts/export_preferences_to_md.py` and `scripts/export_sources_to_md.py`
   - **Proof:** Screenshots of generated Obsidian-ready markdown files
   - **Demo:** Video showing script execution and file generation

2. **DELIVERABLE: Mobile Workflow Implementation**
   - **Artifact:** iOS Shortcuts with documented setup process
   - **Proof:** Screenshots of shortcuts running on iPhone
   - **Demo:** Screen recording of brain dump ‚Üí preference update ‚Üí pipeline refresh

3. **DELIVERABLE: Bidirectional Sync System**
   - **Artifact:** Working sync between Obsidian edits and pipeline config
   - **Proof:** Before/after screenshots showing preference changes reflected in scoring
   - **Test:** Document complete round-trip workflow with timestamps

### Calendar Integration Evolution (Month 2)
Current stub-based availability needs real Google Calendar integration.

**PHASED DELIVERABLES:**
1. **DELIVERABLE: OAuth Integration**
   - **Artifact:** Working Google Calendar OAuth with stored credentials
   - **Proof:** Screenshots of successful calendar connection and token refresh
   - **Demo:** Live calendar read showing actual busy/free periods

2. **DELIVERABLE: Real Availability Detection**
   - **Artifact:** `data/out/actual_availability.md` showing real calendar conflicts
   - **Proof:** Side-by-side comparison of stub vs real availability data
   - **Demo:** Pipeline run showing events filtered by actual calendar conflicts

3. **DELIVERABLE: Event Acceptance Tracking**
   - **Artifact:** `data/out/user_feedback_log.md` tracking event outcomes
   - **Proof:** Screenshots showing accepted/declined event tracking
   - **Demo:** Scoring adjustments based on user acceptance patterns

## 6. Process Excellence Observations

### Exemplary Practices to Continue:
- **Documentation First:** Sprint summary quality enables effective coaching
- **Test-Driven Validation:** 13 passing tests provide confidence for refactoring
- **Security Mindedness:** Proper secrets handling from the start
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation allows focused improvements

### Process Optimization Opportunities:
- **Performance Monitoring:** Add runtime metrics to detect performance regressions
- **User Feedback Loop:** Plan mechanism for capturing event selection effectiveness
- **Automated Health Checks:** Consider daily pipeline runs with status reporting

## 7. Decision Points for Human Review

### Technical Decisions:
1. **Source Failure Strategy:** When scrapers fail, should LLM research be automatic fallback or require explicit enabling?
2. **Scoring Calibration:** Should scoring weights auto-adjust based on user behavior or remain manually configured?
3. **Calendar Integration Timing:** Wait for API activation success before starting OAuth setup, or proceed in parallel?

### Product Decisions:
1. **Event Selection Philosophy:** Current 8 events per week‚Äîis this the right volume for sustainable engagement?
2. **Recommendation Granularity:** Daily markdown shows great detail‚Äîis this the right consumption format?
3. **Mobile Workflow Priority:** Should Obsidian integration come before or after calendar integration?

## 8. Immediate Next Actions (FOCUSED)

### For Development Team:
**ONLY ONE TASK THIS WEEK:**
1. **Create Perfect LLM Research Markdown**
   - **DELIVERABLE:** `data/out/weekly_llm_research.md` with high-quality LLM event discovery
   - **DELIVERABLE:** Working `data/out/winners.ics` file for calendar import
   - **TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:** Gemini 2.5 Pro API calls with full web access working
   - **PROOF:** LLM research contains detailed website analysis (not just metadata)

**DO NOT START OTHER TASKS** until this deliverable is perfect.

### For Product Leadership:
1. **REVIEW MARKDOWN:** Examine the LLM research file for quality and completeness
2. **TEST CALENDAR:** Import the ICS file and verify event quality
3. **APPROVE NEXT:** Only after markdown is excellent, approve additional features

### Critical Success Check:
**If LLM research file shows empty events or placeholders, STOP all other work and fix the Gemini API integration with proper web access first.**

## 9. Risk Assessment
