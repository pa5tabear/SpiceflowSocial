## 1. Header Section

This section should provide an at-a-glance summary of the week's plan.

**Layout:**

```markdown
# Weekly Event Review - {start_date} to {end_date}

**Status:** {event_count} events selected for the next 7 days
**Last Updated:** {update_timestamp} (America/Detroit)
**ICS File:** `data/out/winners.ics` (Ready to import into your calendar)
```

## 2. Daily Breakdown Section

This is the core of the review. Each day should be a distinct sub-section. The goal is to make it easy to scan and take action.

### 2.1. Event Card (When Events are Selected)

Use a clear, structured format for each event. The `Actions` line is critical for the LLM-based editing workflow.

**Layout:**

```markdown
### {Day of Week}, {Month} {Day}

**‚úÖ APPROVED** {Event Title}
- **When:** {Start Time} - {End Time}
- **Where:** {Location Name}, {Location Address}
- **Why Selected:** {Fit Rationale from LLM}
- **Score:** {Overall Score} (career: {career_score}, social: {social_score}, ...)
- **Notes:** {Key details from LLM, e.g., speaker, context}
- **Actions:** [ ] Keep [ ] Modify [ ] Cancel
```

### 2.2. Empty Day Card (When No Events are Selected)

When a day has no events, it should still be presented clearly, framing it as an opportunity.

**Layout:**

```markdown
### {Day of Week}, {Month} {Day}

**üîç NEEDS REVIEW** No events currently selected.
- **Suggestions:** This evening is open. Consider a spontaneous outing, a rest day, or use the commands below to find an alternative.
- **Actions:** [ ] Find alternatives [ ] Keep open [ ] Add specific search
```

## 3. Weekly Overview Section

This section provides a high-level summary of how the selected events align with the user's weekly goals as defined in `preferences.yaml`.

**Layout:**

```markdown

## 4. Quick Edit Commands Section

This is a user-facing guide on how to interact with this document via an LLM. It empowers the user to edit their week declaratively.

**Layout:**

```markdown

- **"Approve all suggested events for the week."**
- **"Cancel the event on Tuesday evening."**

## 5. Rolling Update Preview Section

This section manages expectations by explaining what will happen in the next automated run.

**Layout:**

```markdown

- Preserve all **‚úÖ APPROVED** events.
