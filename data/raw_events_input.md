There's a cool concert at The Ark on Friday night. The band is called American Aquarium and they are a great alt-country act. Starts at 8pm on Oct 3. The Ark is at 316 S. Main. Tickets are probably around $30.

I heard about a possible tech talk from the GDG Ann Arbor group. It might be about Machine Learning on Wednesday, Oct 1st in the evening. Probably at a Google office. Need to verify this, it's just a rumor.

Also, the A2AC Gallery has an exhibition called "Organic Fiction". It's supposed to be abstract paintings. It's ongoing, so it should be available all week. The gallery is at 117 W. Liberty St. This could be a good, low-key social option for Thursday.

What about Monday? Is there anything going on? Maybe a happy hour or something? Could be a good night to rest too.

For Sunday, there's a thing called "Sunday Morning Physics" but it's in the morning. Not really an evening event so probably skip it. Let's keep Sunday evening free for planning.
